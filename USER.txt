1. Before coming to Berkeley, I was working full-time as web developer. 
The most recent project I worked on is Bing map licensing 
(http://www.microsoft.com/maps/Licensing/licensing.aspx). I applied 
HTML, CSS, Javascript and rewrote some code in JQuery. At first the logic 
in PRD was very tidy that I even adopted JSON for the main data structure. 
However, our clients changed the requirment at the last day. I redid most 
of the design and I don't like it. Still I got a lot of hands-on 
experience in cross-device development, cross-browser testing.

2. Chrome is my first choice. As a developer, I love its developer tool 
esp. "what you see is what you get" CSS editor; As a user, I enjoy its 
compatibility. IE 10 is my second choice. In its developer tool, I can 
easily test all the effects from IE7 to IE10. Nowaday, users can hardly 
notice the features of browsers. In my eyes, performance is all that 
matters.
